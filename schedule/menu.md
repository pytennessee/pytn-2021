===============================

Food is provided to all attendees of the conference.
We will serve breakfast and lunch both days, as well as dinner during the [Game Night]({% link schedule/game-night.md %}).
Breakfast is served from 8am until the conference starts each day at 9am.
Lunch service starts around 11:45am and ends at approximately 1:15pm.

If you can't make the times above and need us to save you some food, please let a volunteer know and we will prepare a plate and set it aside for you.

*Note*: As many dietary restrictions/preferences that can be accommodated will be accommodated once we have more information from attendees.
Those menus will be posted here when we have them.
