    To everyone in our PyTennessee community,
  </p>
  <p>
    We have sad news today.
    It has been a tough decision for all involved, but we have decided to cancel PyTennessee 2021.
    We have ultimately realized that we will be unable to put on the kind of PyTN that we want to in 2021 so we are choosing to wait until we can return at full speed with PyTennessee 2022.
  </p>
  <p>
    We truly appreciate the people who picked up tickets, the people who submitted talks, and the people who have donated their time and money.
    Thank you, we see and appreciate you.
    We hope everyone will consider coming back with us when we return for PyTN2022 (and hopefully we'll be in person by then)!
  </p>
  <p>
    Please keep an eye on this page and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/pytennessee">our Twitter</a> for information about PyTN 2022 as it becomes available.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hope to see you in 2022,<br/>
    The PyTN 2021 Organizers
