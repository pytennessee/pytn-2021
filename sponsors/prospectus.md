## {{ site.data.event.name }} Sponsorship Prospectus

_Thank you for your interest in {{ site.data.event.name }}! Below you'll find some information that will hopefully help make your decision to support {{ site.data.event.full_abbreviation }} an easy one._

### About {{ site.data.event.name }}

{{ site.data.event.short_name }} is (typically) a yearly regional Python conference held in Nashville, TN.
This year's {{ site.data.event.short_name }} will be our 8th year, and our first entirely virtual conference!
Unlike in years past where we've had multiple talk tracks and tutorials, this year {{ site.data.event.short_nam }} will be a single day, single track conference.
The talks will be a mix of more traditional 30min talks and some shorter, Lightning Talk style talks.
This will also be the first year we will have all talks (pre-)recorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel so even people who missed the conference can enjoy the talks.

{{ site.data.event.short_name }} is a nonprofit event facilitated by TechFed Nashville, a Tennessee nonprofit organization whose mission is to support and grow the grassroots tech talent in Middle Tennessee through educational events and groups.
TechFed provides financial stewardship, risk management and volunteer leadership development for Nashville-area technology events.

### Expected Audience

{{ site.data.event.name }} has sold out each of the past 5 years, and typically hosts approximately 300 attendees, the majority of whom are professional Python developers or developers interested in learning more about Python.
The skill levels among attendees is generally diverse and ranges from people just learning Python to bona fide experts.
Similarly, our attendees cover a wide range of areas of expertise: data scientists/engineers, web developers, Python core developers, systems/framework developers, and more.
With {{ site.data.event.full_abbreviation }} being online and free to attend, we anticipate this year to be the biggest {{ site.data.event.short_name }} yet!

### Sponsorship Levels

We've dramatically simplified our sponsorship options this year, and both levels are more limited than in years past.
