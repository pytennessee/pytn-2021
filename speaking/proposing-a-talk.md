## Proposing a Talk

We're thrilled you're interested in speaking at {{ site.data.event.short_name }}!
This page endeavors to help you craft the best proposal possible and help you get your talk accepted to {{ site.data.event.name }}.
It's important to keep in mind, however, that {{ site.data.event.short_name }} gets more proposals than we can accept and even with a great propsal we can't guarantee that any individual proposal will be accepted.
If you have any questions about your proposal or would like any feedback on your proposal, please feel free to [contact the organizers](mailto:{{ site.data.event.organizers_email }}).

If you'd like any information about what it's like to speak at {{ site.data.event.short_name }} or what kinds of things are available to {{ site.data.event.short_abbreviation }} speakers, please see our [Speaking Overview]({% link speaking/overview.md %}) page.

## Topics and Advice

Acceptable topics at {{ site.data.event.short_abbreviation }} cover a wide range. As long as your topic can be reasonably seen as relating to Python, it's a great candidate for a talk.
Of course not all talks have to be technical in nature.
{{ site.data.event.short_name }} strives to create a conference with a good balance between technical talks and professional skills talks.
Want to talk about Django? Perfect.
Want to talk about diversity and inclusion? Excellent.
Want to talk about upcoming Python features? We love it.
Want to tell people how you use Python to better manage your recipe collection? Please do!
{{ site.data.event.short_name }} prides itself in being a place where speakers can take risks and try out new things.
If you think something might make a good talk, then we're likely to agree with you.

Recent blog posts, tweets, articles, and open source projects can be a great source of inspiration for a talk.
Your own experience as a developer is another.
Remember, someone will always be where you were 6 months ago, and they'd love to know what you know right now.

Once you've picked your topic, you might try reading one or more of the posts linked below.
These are blog posts from the Python community about the talk proposal process, and there's plenty of good advice and information contained within:

* [On Conference Speaking](https://hynek.me/articles/speaking/) by Hynek Schlawack
* [Rejected PyCon Proposals](http://akaptur.com/blog/2014/09/11/rejected-pycon-proposals/) by Allison Kaptur
* [Example PyCon talk proposals](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2013/example-pycon-proposals/) by Brandon Rhodes
* [Pro Tips from Conference Talks](http://craigkerstiens.com/2012/06/19/pro-tips-for-conference-talks/) by Craig Kersteins
* [Writing an Effective Talk Proposal](https://benramsey.com/blog/2012/11/writing-an-effective-talk-proposal/) by Ben Ramsey

_Note_: some of the articles above are about conferences other than {{ site.data.event.short_name }} and even languages other than Python, but the lesson contained therein will generalize well to a {{ site.data.event.short_abbreviation }} proposal.


## Speaker Mentoring

If you've never given a conference talk before, then {{ site.data.event.short_name }} is a great place to give your first talk!
This year {{ site.data.event.short_name }} is trying something new: providing speaker mentoring from a professional coach to first-time speakers*!
We will have 10 slots available for first time speakers to get feedback and advice on how to make their talks as effective as possible.
Once your talk has been accepted, you'll receive an email from the organizers with a link that will allow you to sign up for a mentoring session with our coach.
Speaker mentoring will be a free service provided by {{ site.data.event.short_name }}, so speakers needn't worry about their ability to pay for a coaching session.


## Generally Good Ideas

* Submit your proposal early. The earlier you submit your talk, the more opportunity we have to provide feedback and help you craft the best proposal possible.
* Have a good sense for who your intended audience is and what you expect them to get out of your talk. This will help focus your proposal, talk, and your preparations.
* Some of the best proposals include an outline of the talk. This lets the reviewers visualize the talk and demonstrates that you've given the topic and the talk real thought.
* If you're basing your talk on a blog post or open source project or anything you can link to, you should link to it in your proposal.
* If there's a video of you giving this talk before at another conference or at a local meetup, please include a link to the video in your proposal.


## Things to Avoid

* Avoid "pitch talks": we love when people talk about their company, their work, or their projects, but a proposal that is just a pitch for a particular product/project is unlikely to be selected. If your product/project solves a given problem, a more appropriate proposal would be about how that project/product helped your/your company solve a particular problem.
* Don't submit a partial or incomplete proposal: during the first round of reviews, we won't be able to see anyone's name, and will be judging talks solely on the strength of the proposal.
