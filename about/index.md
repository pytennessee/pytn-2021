## About the Talks

{{ site.data.event.short_name }} is a developer-focused Python conference with talk topics running the gamut between beginner and advanced, and from web development to data science and machine learning.
The majority of our talks are Python-focused, but in addition to the Python-related topics, we also look for and encourage Python-adjacent and "professional skills" talks to provide a more complete experience.
Developers are more than the single language they write in, and {{ site.data.event.short_name }} attempts to reflect that in our talk selection.
