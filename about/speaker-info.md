## Information for {{ site.data.event.short_abbreviation }} Speakers

The [{{ site.data.event.short_name }} venue]({% link about/venue.md %}) is a school, so is reasonably well set up for speakers.
Each room has a podium in the front of the room with screen projection above the speaker's head.
The seating in most rooms is stadium seating (the only exception is Room 400, which is used mostly for Tutorials).
Power is available at each podium, but {{ site.data.event.short_name }} does not provide power adapters by default.
We may have a few extras floating around, and we can certainly help you source one if you forgot yours.


## Talk Room Setup

The [{{ site.data.event.short_name }} venue]({% link about/venue.md %}) is a school, so is reasonably well set up for speakers to give their talks without amplification, but microphones will be provided in each room in case the speaker would like to use one, or the audience needs the speaker to use one.
The seating in most rooms is stadium seating (the only exception is Room 400, which is flat), and all rooms contain desks or tables and enough power outlets for every attendee to have power.
Each room has a podium in the front of the room with screen projection above the speaker's head.
Rooms are equipped with projectors that are capable of displaying a 16:10 aspect ratio, though the screens in the rooms are only 4:3.
We recommend that you format your slides for 4:3, but if your presentation requires 16:9, we can simply roll up the projector during your presentation.

The speaking rooms are already set up for HDMI and VGA connections, but if your computer doesn't have those ports, the conference will provide the following A/V adapters:

* USB-C to HDMI
* Mini DisplayPort to HDMI
* Mini DisplayPort to VGA

If you require an adapter that isn't listed above, or you need any other special accommodations for your talk, please [let the organizers know](mailto:{{ site.data.event.organizers_email}}).


## Talk Recording
{{ site.data.event.full_abbreviation }} does not currently record speakers talks.
If we find a vendor to help us record talks, each speaker will be the given the opporunity to opt-in to having their talk recorded.
While the conference will not record talks officially, attendees are free to record talks if they'd like to.
We ask that any attendee interested in recording a talk ask the speaker and the in-room volunteer prior to recording.
If a speaker does not want attendees to record talks themselves, please indicate this to the in-room volunteer prior to the talk. 


## Internet Access for Speakers

The venue provides wireless internet, however, sometimes the connectivity can be spotty due to an over-saturated network.
It is _highly_ recommended that your talk not require internet access, or that you have an offline strategy for your talk if the wifi isn't cooperating.
If your talk or tutorial requires packages be installed, please bring a USB thumb drive or some other mechanism to distribute the necessary materials.


## Quiet Room

If you need a quiet place to sit and run through your talk or just want somewhere to sit that's away from the rest of the conference attendees, {{ site.data.event.short_name }} will have a quiet room available for your use.
If you have any questions about the quiet room while at the conference, please find an organizer and they will be happy to answer them for you.
